        <h1>Network Security: A Brief Overview</h1>
      </header>
      <article class="post-content">
        Network security is a broad term that encompasses various technologies,
        devices, and processes that are designed to protect computer networks
        and data from cyber attacks. Network security is a critical component of
        any organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure, as it helps to prevent
        unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources. Network
        security is achieved through a combination of hardware and software
        technologies, such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and
        antivirus software. These technologies work together to detect and block
        malicious activity on a network, such as malware infections,
        unauthorized access attempts, and data breaches. Network security is an
        ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and maintenance to
        ensure that the network is protected against the latest threats and
        vulnerabilities.
